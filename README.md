#  Merton’s Model in Credit Risk Modelling with Importance Sampling
## Overview

This project Implements a Level 2 Importance Sampling simulation to explicitly model discrete, catastrophic default scenarios. Standard regulatory models (Basel ASRF) assume portfolios are infinitely granular. This underestimates tail risk for "lumpy" portfolios where idiosyncratic defaults of large borrowers do not diversify away.
